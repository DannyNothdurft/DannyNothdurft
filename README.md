### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Danny and I'm currently learning programming at Digital Career Institute gGmbH (DCI).
In my spare time I try my hand at small projects that I have here in the reposentories.
The biggest project I'm going to start now is "OnlineTraidingCard", where users can sign up and get a free trading card every day. This trading card will then be displayed on a shelf in the user's profile.
